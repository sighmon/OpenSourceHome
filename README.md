Design
------

* The postcard was designed in [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/illustrator.html), but the file is available here as an .eps file, which can be opened in a vector art application such as [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org).
* The zine was designed in [Adobe InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/indesign.html), and is available to download as a .idml file (an XML representation of the InDesign file), which is the most interchangeable format I could export. You could then open it using this Python library: [SimpleIDML](https://bitbucket.org/Stanislas/simpleidml).

Font
----

The font used for the design is [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which is available from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).
